# Blood-Pit-2 Deluxe Edition 


 I have added a bunch of new QOL features including an alert/hint system, sound effects and made 'death' more noticable by adding an additional button to pause action. 
 
 I have added more enemies and artwork and changed the algorithm how next enemy is selected to improve gameplay and balance
 
 Added an in game shop so completing the game is more about strategy and resource management than 'luck'
